        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            Many pieces of clothing are invented for a functional purpose before they ever become fashionable, but as
            they become symbolic of a certain kind of lifestyle or aesthetic, certain items become expressive of
            meaning. Fashion allows individuals to create and craft images of themselves, expressing their identity to
            other people and potentially arousing feelings of curiosity or commonality. Fashion is often fueled by the
            desire to be different enough to stand out but similar enough to belong to the group that your clothing
            helps identify.

        <p>
            Just as painting, writing and photography can be used as forms of artistic expression, the creation and
            wearing of fashion can similarly express creative energy. For people interested in fashion, especially those
            interested in making their own clothes by hand, sometimes the process of creating the item or the pure
            beauty of the item itself can hold more importance than any personal or generational statement of dress or
            meaning.
