        The main aim of this site is to ease the lives of students on campus, and there are 3 major ways we as a company hope to achieve this through fast, affordable, and customer centered services. 

        First of all, this site is focused on fast delivery of services. This site will be based on campus with students as both the target vendors and customers where services offered by the vendors are most likely available for the students/customers who require them. The job of the website is to directly connect the customer in need of a service to the vendor that offer such services, such that they directly interact and talk about the service of focus. While this is not an online store like Amazon and co., this site focus on services that are already available and ready to be dispatched. 

        Another thing this site aim at is to ease the cost of living of students on campus. We do this when we help students who offer services which are side hustle to them, reach their customers of choice, increasing the money they earn significantly. In due time, we hope that our site will reach a wide variety of students in need of different services, we make life easier for the vendors, and even the customers as services offered by students will be cheaper compared to other official stores. As more students/vendors join the company, they stand to make more profit than when they manually have to be on the lookout for customers.


        Our site is customer oriented, as there will be a direct interaction between the customers and the vendor, giving customers the opportunity to make their request and special, affordable, and streamlined as possible. 

        Students who serve as customers can after creating account and verifying themselves via school IDs, picture and contact information, can easily get access to their service of choice, and the vendors that dispense them as easy as searching for the said services. Different results related to the product from different vendors and their contact information are displayed, therefore customer can choose from the many options available. 

        Students who serve as vendors also go through thorough registration and verification process both for themselves and their products, to prevent scams as much as possible.


        The site will have:
        • A homepage
        • An Account page
        • A market page
        • A "contact us" page
