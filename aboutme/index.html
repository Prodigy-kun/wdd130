    <p>Hey guys, it's nice to start a new semester with you all, I am so glad to start my journey as a web developer,
        i'm so excited because i will finally be able to analyse some of my favorite tech site a nd hopefully be able to
        create something like that.</p>
    <p>Outside BYU, I am studying to become a mechanical engineering and just like you guys, things can be overwhelming.
        But I have faith that God will put me through all the challenges and lead me to a better future. I love technology, and i want to be involved with it in the nearest future. I also love science, cosmology, and phtotgraphy.
    </p>
    <p>I love the church, for opportunities like this and much more, I'm so grateful to be a member both spiritually and physically. I pray for a better semester for us all.</p>
